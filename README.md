# Clean architecture in Android with Kotlin + RxJava + Dagger 2

  Here, in UPTech we spend a lot of time developing successful architecture patterns for an android application, weâ€™ve decided to share our experience with the community.

  The task is to create a maintainable solution with interchangeable parts, which will allow us to easily change implementations on each application layer.
  Solution must smoothly work with android threading and be easy to understand for new developers

  The Solution is our adaptation of Clean Architecture principles.
